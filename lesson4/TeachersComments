Well done!

4.
a) -0.5
There was a word "DISTINCT names". You should use COUNT(DISTINCT). In this case the final number is correct, but it's just an occasion.
b)-0.25
You needed to insert only 2 rows, not the whole table.
f)-0.5
The part about top 1 you already did - for the current year only. It's the row in the select with dense_rank 1. The same should be done to SalesLastYear.
Creating of new field must be done with functions, as we did on the last lesson.
g)-2
No solution.
5) -0.5
count(1) is incorrect. We've already done this exercise in the classwork. Go back and find it.
